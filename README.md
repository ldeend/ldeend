## Professional Bio
Hi, my name's Lucas. I am a **Statistics** and **Economics** Major and a **Data Science** Minor at the University of Notre Dame with experience in data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization. I specialize in predictive modeling and focus on real-world problems, especially in economics and finance.

## Technical Skills
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, PyTorch, scikit-learn
- Visualization
- Office 365
- Tableau
- Ethical GenAI usage

## Current Projects
As an avid basketball fan, I am exploring datasets related to college basketball to hopefully make a successful March Madness Bracket. Here is the link to the primary dataset I am using: [College Basketball Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewsundberg/college-basketball-dataset/data).

## Goals
>My end goal is to be technically rigorous, understandable, and trustworthy with my projects, aspects that I think will allow me to thrive as a data science in a future with AI.

By the end of this semester, I hope to be able to have a strong machine learning toolkit and intuition to tackle a variety of problems, as well as the communication skills to share my results in an interesting, effective, and memorable way. Specifically, I want to become proficient in the following areas:
- Model Selection and Evaluation
- Data Visualization and Storytelling
- Ethical Research and Data Usage
